# Business Continuity Policy

**Company:** AcmeCloud Analytics  
**Product:** AcmeCloud Analytics cloud analytics platform for business reporting  
**Document Type:** Synthetic internal policy for demo use  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** 2026-01-15  
**Owner:** Reliability and Continuity Team  

## 1. Purpose

This Business Continuity Policy describes how AcmeCloud Analytics prepares for service interruptions, operational disruptions, and recovery activities affecting the AcmeCloud Analytics cloud analytics platform. The policy is fictional and intended for use as synthetic evidence in a RAG demo.

The objective of business continuity planning is to help AcmeCloud Analytics maintain essential operations, recover platform services, and communicate internally during disruptive events.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to the AcmeCloud Analytics production platform, supporting infrastructure, incident coordination processes, backup restoration activities, and internal roles responsible for maintaining product availability.

This policy does not define financial disaster recovery commitments, customer-specific service credits, or legally binding service level agreements. Any question about contractual uptime commitments requires review of the relevant customer agreement, which is not included in this evidence set.

## 3. Continuity Objectives

AcmeCloud Analytics maintains business continuity practices for the following objectives:

- Preserve availability of the cloud analytics platform where reasonably possible.
- Restore critical reporting services after a major disruption.
- Maintain access to encrypted backups.
- Coordinate response activities across engineering, security, support, and executive stakeholders.
- Document lessons learned after major disruptions.

The platform is designed with recovery planning in mind, but this policy does not state a specific Recovery Time Objective or Recovery Point Objective. Questions asking for exact RTO or RPO values are not fully answerable from the provided evidence.

## 4. Backup Controls

Backups are encrypted and tested quarterly. Backup testing is performed to confirm that selected production backup data can be restored into a controlled non-production recovery environment. Test results must record the system tested, test date, responsible engineer, result, and any follow-up actions.

Backup restoration tests are coordinated by the Reliability and Continuity Team with support from Platform Engineering. If a test fails, the responsible team must document the failure, identify corrective actions, and retest after remediation.

Backup data remains classified as restricted data. Restored backup copies must not be used for employee training, analytics experiments, sales demonstrations, or public portfolio samples.

## 5. Disruption Scenarios

The continuity plan considers several categories of disruption:

- Production application outage.
- Analytics processing delay.
- Loss of access to a supporting infrastructure service.
- Administrative account compromise affecting production operations.
- Regional service degradation in the primary hosting environment.
- Security incident requiring containment actions.
- Unavailability of a key internal operations tool.

The policy does not specify exact failover architecture or name any real infrastructure provider. Because this evidence set is fictional, no real hosting provider, region name, data center, or subprocessor is listed.

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

The **Reliability and Continuity Team** owns the business continuity process and coordinates continuity reviews.

The **Platform Engineering Team** supports service restoration, deployment rollback, infrastructure recovery, and technical troubleshooting.

The **Security Operations Team** supports continuity events that involve suspected unauthorized access, account compromise, or security monitoring concerns.

The **Customer Support Team** helps collect customer-facing symptoms and distribute approved status updates.

The **Incident Response Lead** is involved when a continuity event is caused by or related to a security incident. Critical security incidents are escalated to the incident response lead under the Incident Response Policy.

## 7. Continuity Activation

A continuity event may be declared when a disruption affects critical platform functions, customer reporting availability, production access, or recovery operations. The event owner records the start time, affected systems, suspected cause, response team, and current recovery status.

If the event is security-related, Security Operations determines whether the event should also be handled as a security incident. Security incidents are triaged within 24 hours under the Incident Response Policy.

## 8. Testing and Review

Business continuity plans are reviewed at least annually. Backup restoration is tested quarterly. The annual review checks whether roles, contact paths, critical systems, and recovery assumptions remain accurate.

This policy does not state that full disaster recovery exercises are performed every quarter. It also does not include test results, screenshots, or evidence of a completed external audit.

## 9. Customer Communication

Customer-facing communication during a continuity event must be approved before release. The support team may provide status updates after the event owner confirms the scope and approved wording.

This policy does not provide a public status page URL, customer notification deadline, or contractual communication requirement. Those details are not specified in the provided evidence.

## 10. Limitations

This synthetic policy does not claim that AcmeCloud Analytics has achieved any external certification or completed an independent business continuity audit. It is intended only as fictional evidence for a trust/security questionnaire RAG workflow.
